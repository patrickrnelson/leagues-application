# Nature of the North - Leagues Application

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

Client project for Prime Digital Academy. We worked with Nature of the North to develop an application for their bouldering leagues. The client wanted climbers in the league to be able to track their climbs every week and submit certain climbs to go towards their team's score. They also wanted a leaderboard so the teams would have visibility into how their team is doing in comparison to other teams in the league. There is also admin functionality that allows the admin to see each team, their climbers, all of the climbs, and mark whether or not the team has paid their league dues. 

To see the fully functional site, please visit the [deployed version of the app](https://notn-leagues.herokuapp.com/)

### Prerequisites
To start this project please have these set of software programs downloaded to your computer. 
- A code editor of your choice [VS Code ](https://code.visualstudio.com/) OR [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [postgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) 

## Installation

1. Clone code from Github
2. Open the project folder in an editor of your choice. 
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder. Run an `npm install`
4. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
  ```
  SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
  ```
  While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.

5. Open your database application of choice. This project is built with [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico create a database and to run the queries.

6. Create a database named `notn`.

7. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. 

8. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
9. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
10. The project will open in a new tab in your default browser! If not navigate in your local browser to `localhost:3000`

## Usage

### Admin
1. Login using the provided Admin login. 
2. Create a new league using the 'Create League' button. Name the league, and choose the start and end dates for the league. 
3. Once you have created a league, you have the option to edit the league information (name and dates) with the 'Edit' button or delete the league with the 'Delete' button. If you click the 'Delete' button a dialogue will pop up asking you to confirm the league that you want to delete. 
4. Clicking on the 'Teams' link in the navigation bar will navigate you to a page that lists the teams that are in the current league. 
5. There is a dropdown that allows you to select past leagues. 
6. Clicking on a team name will show the climbers on that team, the paid status of the team, and all of the climbs that team has done.
7. If a team has not paid, an indicator will show beneath the team name that says 'Has not paid'. The admin will be able to click into the team and change the paid status of the team. 

### Climber
1. Register for an account.
2. Click the 'Create a Team' button and enter in a new team name.
3. If a league is open, click 'Join League' on the home page.
3. If a league is not open, the app will say so and you can check back later. 
4. When you join a league you must pay the league dues to NOTN, and they will mark your team as paid in the admin view.
5. Once your team has paid and the league has started, you and your team will be able to start a climbing session.
6. In the climbing session, click 'Add climbs' to add your climbs for the week. You can add as many climbs as you would like. 
7. Once you and your team have completed all of your climbs, the team captain can click the 'submit' checkbox on 10 of the climbs.

- Each climber must have 3 climbs submitted, and the 10th climb can come from any climber

8. Click on the 'team' link in the menu to see the climbers on your team and their total score for the current league.
9. Click on the 'leaderboard' link in the menu to see all of the teams in the current league and their respective scores. Your team will be highlighted. 
10. The 'Rules' page in the menu lists the rules for the league. 
11. The 'About' page in the menu lists information about NOTN and the leagues.
12. The 'Profile' link in the menu will take you to a page where you can see and edit the information associated with your user profile.

## Built With

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js, React, Redux, Sagas, Material-UI, Moment.js
<!-- List technologies and frameworks here -->

## Known Bugs

- Logging out as an admin and trying to login as a user will direct you to a 404. Simply change the URL in the address bar to be only the base URL (notnleagues.herokuapp.com) to go back to the home screen of the app.
- ADMIN - Refreshing the 'Edit League' page will cause the league information to disappear.
- ADMIN - The list of teams on the 'Teams' page will sometimes re-order when changing the paid status of a team. 
- CLIMBER - The list of climbs in the 'Climbing Session' page will sometimes re-order when changing the submitted status of a climb. 
- CAPTAIN - Deleting a climber from your team while your team is in the middle of a climbing session will break the scoring for that session.
